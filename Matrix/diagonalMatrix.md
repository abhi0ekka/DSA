# Diagonal Matrix :

- Diagonal Matrix the normal defination.
- So, the main point is if we have a diagonal matrix.
- Then, it have a lot of unnecessary space.
- So, we store them in a linear Array.
- How we save them :
  - We know that Diagonal matrix have element only at the position (i,j) where, i=j.
